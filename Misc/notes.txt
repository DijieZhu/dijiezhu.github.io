Outside research, I like swimming, football (soccer), and basketball. I also unwind with games—especially Minecraft and CS. I enjoy taking photos and hope to study photography more seriously. I value long-term commitment while still aiming for concrete short-term progress. I cherish time with friends and family and I’m always happy to meet new people—many generous people helped lead me here.
